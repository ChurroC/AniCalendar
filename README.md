# AniCalendar

**NOTE:** This is only for users that are using AniList to track their anime and mange progress! 

Look at your anime watch history through a calendar. Many users from AniList were asking for a calendar to view their anime watch history instead of the small activity history on their profile. So I decided to create a website that shows their calendar.

Made with Nextjs.

- Generate an image of your calendar
- Names of anime and their EP are displayed on the calendar
- Look on the calendar to know on which day you completed an anime

```
    
## Roadmap

- Refactoring
